.TH ELECTRUM.CONF "5" "February 2016" "electrum.conf 0.12"
.SH NAME
electrum.conf \- electrum configuration file
.SH SYNOPSIS
All command-line options (except for '\-conf') may be specified in a configuration file, and all configuration file options may also be specified on the command line. Command-line options override values set in the configuration file.
.TP
The configuration file is a list of 'setting=value' pairs, one per line, with optional comments starting with the '#' character. Please refer to electrumd(1) for a up to date list of valid options.
.TP
The configuration file is not automatically created; you can create it using your favorite plain-text editor. By default, electrumd(1) will look for a file named electrum.conf(5) in the electrum data directory, but both the data directory and the configuration file path may be changed using the '\-datadir' and '\-conf' command-line arguments.
.SH LOCATION
electrum.conf should be located in $HOME/.electrum
