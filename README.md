Electrum Core integration/staging tree
=====================================

What is Electrum?
----------------

Electrum is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Electrum uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Electrum Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. 

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing


**Important**: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next
pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.
